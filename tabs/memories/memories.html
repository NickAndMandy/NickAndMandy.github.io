    <p style="font-size: 3vw;"> hi mandy welcome to memories!! on this page ive put together some
    of the really special memories that weve shared over the years :) also,
    please excuse me if i cant remember something perfectly!! a lot of these
    were a long time ago and i cant really come to you for clarification so,,
    im gonna just do my best :)</p>

    <h1>When We Met</h1>
    <p>so, probably our first memory is when we first met!!
    it was january 4<sup>th</sup> last year, and it was through hailey. we joined a
    call with her and gian and i think maybe some others (?) i dont remember much about
    it cuz it was so long ago but i do remember i was playing minecraft during it, and
    we bonded over danny phantom :)</p>
    <img src="images/goopy.png">
    <p>and gian made this really funny image that i just refer to as <strong><i>GOOPY</i></strong>
    and it still makes me laugh to this day and even though its something gian made to me it
    really represents an "us" memory cuz it was the first time we met and it just makes me
    really happy :)</p>
    <img src="images/first_conversation.png">
    <p>this was also our first conversation!! its so crazy to go back and read them and see
    how different we were and our relationship was. i still feel so bad for calling you
    by the a word but i didnt know it was like such a hated thing to you :( im sorry!!</p>
    <hr>

    <h1>My Confession</h1>
    <p>so the next memory i could think of is when i confessed to you that i was into
    you. it was really scary for me cuz i didnt really think you liked me at all but
    it had been weighing on me for a while and hailey said i should:</p>
    <img src="images/hailey_coersion.png">
    <p>soo i was like ok fine fine ill do it but it was still so scary and like,,
    i really didnt wanna ruin what i already had with you yknow?? like our friendship
    and stuff so it was like aaaaa but oki so i just went for it cuz i just thought
    itd be really nice to get it off my chest so :)</p>
    <img src="images/confession.png">
    <p>anyways yeah i just think its a really special memory to me cuz its kinda like
    what sparked us to start thinking about being more than friends and stuff i guess
    and just kinda an important part of our timeline so i just wanted to include it
    here so :)</p>
    <hr>

    <h1>Hailey's Surprise</h1>
    <p>okkk so next big thing is the surprise for hailey!! this was the first time i ever
    saw you so it was like such a big moment and it was CRAZY cuz youre so much prettier
    than i expected so i was like <i>whaaaaa</i> and you were like *looks gorg* and i
    was like 0.0 ok anyway sadly everyone LEFT THE GROUP CHAT before i knew i was gonna
    make this website so i dont have like pics of it :((( but i do have some of our dms :)</p>
    <img src="images/hailey_surprise.png">
    <p>okii so this was right after the first day so it was like right after the first time
    we saw each other irl so it was like :0 major pog!!! oki so this was crazy cuz ur just so
    pretty and i was like super stunned by you and just by how much fun you are to be aruond
    and it really was just one of the best days of my life.</p>

    <h1>Getting Together</h1>
    <p>so obviously i have to include the time we actually started dating. today!! 6 months ago!!
    (for you. at the time of writing this its only march 9<sup>th</sup> LOL) but anyway yeah this
    was super big and special moment for me and it really is the thing that got us to where we are
    now so like yeah so much love for this and just you and aaaa yeah :)</p>
    <img src="images/getting_together.png">
    <p>soo yeah that was at night right after october 2<sup>nd</sup> and it was such a wild time
    and i remember just feeling so many things and emotions and just wanting to finally be with
    you so bad after all that time of just being into you and having the kinda awko taco relationship
    of like you knowing i liked you and stuff and it just felt really good to finally be together :)</p>
    <hr>

    <h1>Christmas</h1>
    <p>wellll the next big thing that happened is probably christmas. by this point our relationship had
    fully settled in, and we were comfortable being affectionate with each other and stuff like that and
    it was our first time meeting up after actually officially like dating for a while and stuff so like
    crazy!! anyway it was super cold which bothered me a lot but now its been so long since ive seen you
    that im so desperate and id freeze with you any day without complaint :(</p>
    <img src="images/christmas.png">
    <p>anywaysss heres us :) this is one of the ones that you have i think so :D and i just have really
    special memories of being with you and hailey and houde and just going to shoprite and all that and
    thinking back to those times just reminds me that being around you makes me so much happier than i
    could possibly be otherwise and so its super special to me :)</p>
    <hr>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>anyways, i think im gonna end this section here. funny cuz the majority of our relationship is after
    all of that, but its hard cuz i havent really seen you since then so :( but anyway it really has been fun
    mkaking this and remembering some of our best times and just thinking about you :)</p>
