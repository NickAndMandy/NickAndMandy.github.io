    <p>hi mandy! its our 6 month anniversary! The time passes so fast, right??
    I really cant believe its been half a year with you. the time weve shared
    together has really been the best time in my life. youve made me so so
    happy, more so than anything else in my life since we met. i know when we
    first met i was a little depressed and low energy (still am i guess, but
    not as much) but youve really done so much since then to improve me and
    my health!!
    <br><br>
    anyway, i made this to just share some memories and love for you, cuz i
    think sometimes i dont give you enough appreciation :( but anyways i hope
    you like it! i tried to make it all mandy and victorian and stuff so!!
    there are tabs at the top for some memories we share and
    some pics and videos of me thatll hopefully make you smile a bit :) have fun!!
    <br><br>
    also, please dont view this on your wide monitor. it wont look right :(
    </p>
